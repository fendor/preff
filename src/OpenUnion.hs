-- | Open unions (type-indexed co-products) for extensible effects
-- All operations are constant-time, and there is no Typeable constraint
--
-- This is a variation of OpenUion5.hs, which relies on overlapping
-- instances instead of closed type families. Closed type families
-- have their problems: overlapping instances can resolve even
-- for unground types, but closed type families are subject to a
-- strict apartness condition.
--
-- This implementation is very similar to OpenUnion1.hs, but without
-- the annoying Typeable constraint. We sort of emulate it:
--
-- Our list r of open union components is a small Universe.
-- Therefore, we can use the Typeable-like evidence in that
-- universe. We hence can define
--
-- @
-- data Union r v where
--   Union :: t v -> TRep t r -> Union r v -- t is existential
-- @
-- where
--
-- @
-- data TRep t r where
--   T0 :: TRep t (t ': r)
--   TS :: TRep t r -> TRep (any ': r)
-- @
-- Then Member is a type class that produces TRep
-- Taken literally it doesn't seem much better than
-- OpenUinion41.hs. However, we can cheat and use the index of the
-- type t in the list r as the TRep. (We will need UnsafeCoerce then).
--
-- The interface is the same as of other OpenUnionType.hs
